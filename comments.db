He could easily pay more in taxes, how does he avoid paying more taxes: 1) he chooses to \"only\" takes a salary of $100,000 a pittance in comparisons to the value of Berkshire (7th largest publicly listed company in the US), 2) Berkshire Hathaway pays NO dividend- of the 25 largest listed companies in the US, only 4 don't pay dividends (Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Berkshire), 3) in 2014 Berkshire showed \"deferred tax\" of $61B on its balance sheet, these are taxes it recognizes as owed, but by using the tax laws favorably is able deffer paying them. This deferral is 5x larger than 10 years ago and is equal to approx 8 years worth of taxes at their est current rate, 4) In '10, the year before Berkshire paid $9 billion for Lubrizol it paid $90 million in dividends, after the acquisition, the dividends were cut to zero. In '09, the year before Burlington Northern was acquired by Berkshire for $44 billion, Burlington paid $546 million in dividends, after the acquisition zero. In 2012, the year before Heinz was acquired for $28 billion by Berkshire (and 3G Capital) Heinz paid more than $600 million in dividends and yes they too were stopped after the acquisition. Those old dividends used to be taxed and paid to the US Government, now all those taxes are saved and kept within Berkshire Hathaway for his and his investors personal benefit. 5) And the final example I will share is P&G. Warren owned shares in Proctor and Gamble with a cost basis of approx $336m, he used his highly appreciated stocks plus some $$1.7b in case to buy control of P&G's Duracell battery unit for $4.7B, and thus avoided over $1b in capital gain taxes that Berkshire would have paid to the US, had he sold those shares of P&G rather than trading it back to P&G.

Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years, records obtained by The New York Times show.\n\n>Tax experts hired by The Times to analyze Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 records said tax rules that are especially advantageous to wealthy filers would have allowed Mr. Trump to use his $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income over an 18-year period.\n\n[Link to the actual tax form.] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/01/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html)\n\nCampaign response:\n\n>\u201cMr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThat being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes.\u201d\n\n>The statement continued: \u201cMr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it.\u201d\n\nBut according to his accountant:\n\n>Mr. Mitnick was the person Mr. Trump leaned on most to do the spinning. The lawyer and accountant worked for a small Long Island accounting firm that specialized in handling tax issues for wealthy New York real estate families. Mr. Mitnick had long handled tax matters for Mr. Trump\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump, and he said he began doing Donald Trump\u2019s taxes after Mr. Trump turned 18.\n\n>In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Mitnick said he could not divulge details of Mr. Trump\u2019s finances without Mr. Trump\u2019s consent. But he did talk about Mr. Trump\u2019s approaches to taxes, and he contrasted Fred Trump\u2019s attention to detail with what he described as Mr. Trump\u2019s brash and undisciplined style. He recalled, for example, that when Donald and Ivana Trump came in each year to sign their tax forms, it was almost always Ivana who asked the most questions.\n\n>But if Mr. Trump lacked a sophisticated understanding of the tax code, and if he rarely showed any interest in the details behind various tax strategies, Mr. Mitnick said he clearly grasped the critical role taxes would play in helping him build wealth. \u201cHe knew we could use the tax code to protect him,\u201d Mr. Mitnick said.\n\nNet worth:\n\n>The tax documents also do not shed any light on Mr. Trump\u2019s claimed net worth of about $2 billion at that time. This is because the complex calculations of business deductions that produced a tax loss of $916 million are a separate matter from how Mr. Trump valued his assets, the tax experts said.\n\n>Nor does the $916 million loss suggest that Mr. Trump was insolvent or effectively bankrupt in 1995. The cash flow generated by his various businesses that year was more than enough to service his various debts.\n\n\nCharitable giving (or not):\n\n>Because the documents sent to The Times did not include any pages from Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 federal tax return, it is impossible to determine how much he may have donated to charity that year. The state documents do show, though, that Mr. Trump declined the opportunity to contribute to the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans\u2019 Memorial Fund, the New Jersey Wildlife Conservation Fund or the Children\u2019s Trust Fund. He also declined to contribute $1 toward public financing of New Jersey\u2019s elections for governor.\n\nQuote from Trump's accountant himself (who verified the forms were legit):\n\n>Mr. Mitnick, though, said there were times when even he, for all his years helping wealthy New Yorkers navigate the tax code, found it difficult to face the incongruity of his work for Mr. Trump. He felt keenly aware of the fact that Mr. Trump was living a life of unimaginable luxury thanks in part to Mr. Mitnick\u2019s ability to relieve him of the burden of paying taxes like everyone else.\n\n>\u201cHere the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it,\u201d he said.\n\nThis may be on Fahrenthold's level.

This scared me worse than anything that has come out of Trump's sphincter of a mouth.", "Out of context this sounds like weirdly sexual advice.", "I miss Jon Stewart, I can totally see him playing this clip and then saying in that voice \"Why I do declare, I am getting the vapors blah blah cognizant point wrapped in a joke that highlights the underlying hypocracy...\"  All while fanning his face and smiling.  Could have really used that fucker this election, he was like our national sanity check, and now we don't know what's real and what isn't.", "I, for one, welcome Hillary Clinton to slam dunk some nasty comments on Republicans. I like take no prisoners Hillary, and seeing them fuming over her like this, like that video of Trump grinding his teeth and ripping up his notes after the debate when she walks by him all smiles, gives me a reason to believe in the future.\n\n", "And a man needs to be told when he's a dick", "I'm with Hillary.\n\nMadam President, since she's nasty.", "Wow, so he decided not only to defend Trump's outburst, but to make it even MORE blatantly sexist.  Congratulations douchebag.", "The one good thing Trump is doing is shedding light on the basket of deplorables.", "Some times I think there is hope for the GOP. Then they double down on these deplorable comments ", "He claims to be \"genteel\", which apparently means polite and courteous but only until the women-folk get a little uppity.", "Women love being told.", "The reporting should include what prompted Trumps fit when he said 'Such a nasty woman'.     Clinton was outlining her tax plan stating if you make less than 250K a year, you will see no raise in taxes, - then stated that people like Trump and people like her that make more than 250K will see tax rates rise.    At that moment Trump said 'Such a nasty woman'.  \n\nThe fact that it was a discussion of a policy that may result in Trump paying ANY taxes, - was cause for Trump's 'Nasty Woman' remark.", "Even setting aside the gender issue, what she said was barely confrontational. Calling her behavior nasty, when her opponent has spent most of the debate (and the better part of his entire campaign) spouting the most hostile, revolting nonsense ever heard in a modern-day election, is ridiculous.\n\nWhen they can back the candidate who stands there bellowing that his opponent is by far the worst politician that has ever existed, and she's supposed to be \"nasty\" for a slight quip about the fact that a certain presidential nominee doesn't pay taxes, they've relinquished all credibility on the matter.", "Methinks the honorable gentleman doth speak too much.", "Looks like the Lone Star State is gonna have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. If anything finally makes Texas secede, being forced to listen to a woman for the next eight years might be it.", "Why not just slap them? and tell them to back to the kitchen? /s ", "And a man need to be told when he is an asshole.  Beyond that, politicians need to be called out publicly when they blatantly lie through their teeth. ", "how was she being nasty when Trump said that during the debate? Trump has lauded his ability to get out of taxes as \"exhibit A\" evidence of his yuge business brain. She said he might be able to get out of the higher taxes.  Why is that nasty?", "Who is this guy to judge anyone on whether they are \"nasty\" or not? Texas politicians are a constant embarrassment to the citizens of Texas. ", "Did I just wander into the 1940s?   What a dbag", "Jesus Tap Dancing Christ!\n\nWe need such a complete overhaul of those representing us in this country.  ", "Not sure what's more surprising:  That a GOP congressman said this, or that said GOP congressman wasn't Steve King or Louie Gohmert.", "\"Ooo, you're a *nasty* woman! ;) \"\n\nHe might be onto something here.", "You are not helping. Anyone. ", "I'm guessing he can't actually point out anything she said during the debate that was \"nasty\" though.", "Oh good...he's up for re-election this year.", "\"A lady\", eh?  Fuck you and the sexist horse you rode in on Babin.  Texas ladies, I hope you remember this when that congressman is up for re-election.  \n\nEdit:  I just realized all the House seats are up for re-election.  Remember this at the ballot box ladies!", "This is... I mean, sexist and horrible, but also the worst imaginable soundbite. Like, holy shit, he couldn't have packaged his sexism better if he tried", "Super rich coming from the Groping Obstructionist Party that's spent the last umpteen years mansplaining how rape and pregnancy works.", "And he has no real challenger this election. He's from Ted Cruz's 36th Texas district, no dem even filed to run against him. The Green Party candidate running against him lost to him last election 700 votes to 100k votes. He can get away with political murder and he'll have that seat as long as he desires it.", "where does the GOP get these people?", "And sometimes a Republican congressman needs to be told he's a misogynistic, backwards thinking, low intelligence fuckwad.", "He needs to go volunteer in a battered woman's shelter. Honestly, the GOP all seem to lack any self-awareness, humility, and all really embody misogyny as a basic character flaw. ", "This is going to be the election where women shut this whole GOP thing down.", "Please continue,GOP.", "And, if it was a man, he would be described as \"strong\"", "For everyone who enjoyed the racist opposition to Obama the last eight years,  get ready for lots more of this.  It's misogyny's turn.", "you know its bad when Republicans start sounding like Jane Austin characters. ", "Guys, you got this all wrong.  Trump wasn't angry, he was aroused when he said this.  He was just using dirty talk in the debate on Clinton, and this GOP congressman happens to agree.  Let 'em know when they're being nasty.  Let 'em know what you like.  Then grab 'em by the pussy.\n\nIt's all in Trump's new book \"Art of the Feel\"", "This is my new line in the bedroom.", "Yet another GOP congressman who shouldn't be holding his job.", "A man needs to be told when he is being a mega dickhead douche-lord, too, but you don't see me saying that to your face because I actually *have* some southern manners, you fucking carwash gutter ooze.", "I mean, I don't know if I'm supposed to still get worked up about this sort of thing? Yes, many GOP elected leaders are racist/sexist/homophobic/xenophobic/islamophobic/science denying/\"my feels = facts\" douche bags. Their voters don't care because they wish they still lived in the 1950s. It's shitty that 30% of Americans are people that I want nothing to do with, and they get more political influence than they should. \n\nAt this point in the election I'm just too tired to get mad at every shitty statement GOP politicians make - I roll my eyes at them and move on with my day. Let me know when they start sexually assaulting people or acting like democracy is a quaint notion; or give me a couple months after November 28th. Then I'll bring the fiery hate. \n\nEdit: Nvmd. Read the comments. Got cranky after all.  ", "And a GOP congressman needs to be told when he's being a dickhead. If the GOP wants to take political correctness out of the equation, then I think it's about time we fight fire with fire. I know the \"high road\" is preferred, but I'd love to see some people get called out for what they are. A+ assholes who only care about the party line, not the people they supposedly represent.\n\nHow much incivility must liberals/democrats/women/people with a brain take until the bubble is ALLOWED to pop? Is it because I'm a democrat that I can't shove the bullshit right back down their throats?", "Jesus Christ, this party is in for a reckoning over the next decade or two. ", "Strom Thurmond reincarnate.", "[Meme for those who like memes](http://imgur.com/gallery/tFYM1)", "Jesus fucking christ. Just listen to the audio clip. Ignoring the comments about Clinton which have been and will be discussed at length, he flat refuses to acknowledge that he is rewriting history by claiming that Al Gore refused to accept the results of the 2000 election. How deep are the Republicans heads up Trump's fascist oompa loompa ass that they can't see the historical facts?", "A Congressman from Texas needs to be told what the term *genteel Southerner* means.\n\nHint: It does not mean living down to the worst stereotypes about the South for the sake of a nasty orange man with tiny hands."]}}
