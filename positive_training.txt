If people feel that the economy has done well, especially in those regions he pulled out the vote in. If there are no great rollbacks of rights or his rhetoric tones down over time, I think he could win again. Then again, I have no reason to suspect that his rhetoric will get toned down.
Believe or not, he has a lot of things going his way. The media/political class holds him to lower standards. If he mets that standard, he's going to look much better than he is. The economy is good. In fact, we have a good outlook.
If he does a good job as President in his first term, then he'll probably win a second term.
